- move mouse smoothing code into utility LERP method
- move RandomGravity into Vector specific method
- multiple image formats via SDL
- support touch events
- port to ios
- fix collision detection
- view volume culling
- mesh support
- shader support
- have objects affected by physical environment, add weights to objects
- create robust customizable menu system
- change flat primitive (circle, square) bboxes from unit cube to unit square
- make design more generic by having terrain as a static scene object and applying collision detection so that player doesn't fall through
- controllers: act on objects having specific interfaces, eg positional controller calls setPosition, rotational controller calls setRotation, etc
- controllers: are really the ability to update any transform and have a flexible environment
- camera: separate velocity/position updates into controller actions and attach position controller to camera node
- deep copy: create bboxes around all group nodes, clip against view volume + collision detection via intersection tests
- shallow copy: create bboxes around top-level group nodes, clip against view volume + collision detection via countour maps
- implement collision detection using countour maps for speed/memory-challenged platforms
- create non-axis-aligned bbox, currently have axis-aligned bbox + bounding sphere
- axis-aligned bbox + bounding sphere used for visibility determination
- non-axis-aligned bbox + bounding sphere used for collision detection
- think about octree memory requirements and scenarios above it would fit in
- clip objects from view using intersection test of bounding volumes against view volume
- clip objects from view using octree or bsp
- investigate empty group node names in the find bounding volume path (display lists?)
- separate out group node factory to replace primitives with display lists but leave group nodes/bboxes in place for view volumet clipping
- define several cameras and switch between them
- bring back platform-specific timer classes
- use lua file include system to define effects only once
- create a quaternion-based rotation transform
- define a global World structure to pass to the Walk member function
- factor physical model into separate world class
- combine Walk and Update member functions
- revise mirror mechanism - attach mirrored objects to mirror
- add constructor parameters to eliminate double initialization
- factory object creation methods should have parameters for object creation and constructors should
have corresponding parameters so no create methods would be necessary to avoid double initialization (variable arg lists?)
- pay price upfront on object insertion into factory hashtable then instead of going through child lists multiple times just delete the object and remove it from hashtable
- load terrain heights from file
- implement benchmarking that would identify platform capabilities
- make memory optimizing pass over scene graph, resizing vectors to appropriate size
- implement dynamic nodes for animation, actions/predicates/triggers
- glutWMCloseFunc doesn't work?
- generic input model to hook up to any window manager such as glut, sdl, directinput or native os window managers
- make configuration more general, allowing terrain, skin, lights and effects folders to be located anywhere and describe these locations in a script file
- rewrite config more generally so one can add/remove properties
- include timestamps in UDP position update packets
- optimize square root function with newton's method
- check if VectorLengthSquared should be named VectorNorm
- possibly remove mirrors which complicate design
- change Log functions: *Message to *Msg, *Warning to *Wrn, *Error to *Err
- switch logger to use a log file (better yet some faster OS-dependent logging mechanism) instead of console output
- make logging function thread-safe
- change all defines to constants
OK - reduce memory footprint by eliminating node name fields in release build
OK - optimize transformation nodes
OK - check if transform matrices should be replaced by ogl commands only
OK - rename WalkGl to a more generic name without OpenGL
OK - add debug names for all scene noce types
OK - move copy node logic from loader to factory
OK - always refer to static member functions by prefixing them with class name
OK - investigate why primitive bounding boxes for cylinders are translated up in some cases (translation/rotation order?) Last attachment of primitive to group node saves bounding box
OK - remove bounding box member function from particle system, you always go through the particle system, so it's not necessary
OK - investigate why gravity[CY] is not applied to particle system particles, only gravity[CX] and gravity[CZ]
OK - switch off saving and drawing bounding boxes for primitives (primitive.cpp, primitive.h)
OK - only draw bounding volumes for group nodes
OK - move add child node logic from loader to factory
OK - think about implementing copy node operation as a deep copy instead of shallow copy
OK - move perspective transformation logic into camera
NO - remove base Object, move GetHash to static Factory member function - virtual destructor won't be called on void *
NO - implement base object having reference count
NO - implement base object having list of child nodes
